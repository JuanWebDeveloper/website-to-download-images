# website-to-download-images
In this practice I developed a website that allows us to download images by copying their address, when copying the address of the image we will be able to see a preview of it and if for some reason the image or address cannot be found is incorrect, an alert will be displayed to the user, this website is programmed with PHP, CSS and JavaScript.
